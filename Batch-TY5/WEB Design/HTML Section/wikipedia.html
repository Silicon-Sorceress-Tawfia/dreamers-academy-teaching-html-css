                <p>
                    Al-Khwarizmi, also known as Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, was a Persian polymath who significantly contributed to mathematics, astronomy, and geography during the Islamic Golden Age. Born around 780 AD in Khwarazm (modern-day Uzbekistan), he is regarded as the "Father of Algebra."

                <p>The term "algorithm" is derived from the Latinized form of his name, emphasising his influence on computational methods and problem-solving techniques</p>

                <p>

                    Al-Khwarizmi's work had a profound impact on the development of mathematics and science. His book "Kitab al-Jabr wa al-Muqabala" (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing) laid the foundation for algebra and introduced the concept of equations and algorithms. His work was later translated into Latin and had a significant influence on European mathematicians during the Middle Ages.
